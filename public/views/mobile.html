		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>In 2012 I studied Web Development at The Starter League, an intense programming boot camp. While there I honed the skill-set of a digital craftsman. Skills like HTML5, CSS3, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and jQuery have allowed me to work on a multitude of different projects designed for various platforms. I am well accustomed to the challenges of Cross-Browser Quirks, Responsive Development, Mobile Development, and International Development. Working as a professional in the web industry these last few years has opened my eyes to a lot, and I'm reminded every day that I'm never done learning. Most recently I've been diving into new exciting javascript technologies such as AngularJS, ExpressJS, and NodeJS. I want to continue to contribute to making the web a better tool for humanity.</p>
